# ‚õèÔ∏è Minecraft Server Website (Gatsby)

This repository contains the source code for a static website created to provide information and updates for a **Minecraft server**.

The site serves as a central hub for players to find details about the server, news, and potentially rules or connection guides.

## ‚ú® Project Context: Learning Design and Development

This project marks a point in my development journey where I was actively learning about **website design principles** and developing front-end applications.

Building this site with **Gatsby.js** was an opportunity to move beyond basic web pages and explore:

*   Working with **GraphQL** for data querying (common in Gatsby for fetching data from various sources).
*   Integrating **Continuous Integration (CircleCI)** for automated build processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Gatsby.js:** The React-based framework for building the static site.
*   **GraphQL:** Used within Gatsby for querying data sources.
*   **CircleCI:** Used for Continuous Integration/Deployment setup.
*   *(Likely also React and some form of CSS/Styling, e.g., Styled Components, CSS Modules, or global CSS)*

## üì± Key Features

*   Information sections about the Minecraft server.
*   Built as a fast, static site with Gatsby.
*   Data querying powered by **GraphQL**.
*   Setup includes **CircleCI** for automated builds.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is adapted to provide a good viewing experience on devices of **all sizes, including mobile phones**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Project Status

Please be aware that this project was developed **some time ago** and relies on **older versions of its dependencies** (Gatsby framework, various libraries).

As a result, the code in its current state **will likely require significant work to update dependencies** and resolve compatibility issues before it can be successfully built or run.

This repository is kept as a **historical record of my learning and work** at that time, demonstrating the original architecture, styling choices, and the technologies I was exploring.
